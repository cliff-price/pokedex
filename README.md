Pokedex:

A simple application to search for Pokemon character and see details for the selected character

Written in HTML and JavaScript

Diplays a list of all Pokemong chracters, and when selected, runs a modal to diplay the selected character's details

Makes use of promises for asynchronous loading of data from the Pokemon API

Takes advantage of jQuery library and Bootstrap framework

Code has been "de-linted" using ESLink in the Visual Studio Code editor, and minified using a JavaScript minmizer tool

Both the "raw" source code and the "minified" distribution code are stored on the GitHub project repository
